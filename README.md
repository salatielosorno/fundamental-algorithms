# Typescript starter

This is a setup to start to work using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Just need to run

```bash
$ npm run build
```

to convert from ts code to js code

## Clean Code

We must effort to keep clean code and one thing to achieve this, it is the formatting.

We use:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to code conventions
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to auto-formatting based on the ESLint rules.


### Check code conventions

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

### Format
```bash
$ npm run prettier-format
```

## Notes

This can be improved but I prefer to keep it simple.
